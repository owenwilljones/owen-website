This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a concept I nicked from [Steve 'Boring Magic' Messer](https://visitmy.website/now/).

## At the moment I'm...

- frontend developing from within the GOV.UK Design System team
- making my way through the [Deque University WAS course](https://dequeuniversity.com/online-courses/web-accessibility)
- reading [A *New* Program for Graphic Design](https://www.counter-print.co.uk/collections/all-books/products/a-new-program-for-graphic-design)
- learning Portuguese
- trying to get my first belt stripe in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- playing [The Case of the Golden Idol](https://www.thegoldenidol.com/)

## Later on I'd like to...

- explore accessibility training and specialism
- learn [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and get one or more of my small game ideas on the screen
- spend more time making stuff in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)
- play all the games sitting in my steam and switch libraries
