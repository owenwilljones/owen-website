## How I got here

I grew up in a little village in the West Sussex. In 2009 I swapped the Sussex countryside for bracing sea breezes when I went to Portsmouth to study Computer Game Technology. After failing to get into the video games industry and moving back home, I started working on websites and now call myself a frontend developer. In 2018 I severed my ties to nature altogether and moved to London where I currently live.

## What I do for work

At the moment I'm a senior frontend developer working for the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) in the [GOV.UK Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). I've worked in a few places but the ones I thought were most interesting were...

### Shelter

I worked for [Shelter](https://www.shelter.org.uk/) for 2 years in their digital campaigns team and later as part of their digital transformation team, converting a huge CMS monolith into a JAMstack project. Whilst I was there I developed a taste for web Design-with-a-capital-D, tech communities of practice and putting my skills towards a positive cause instead of the sale of a product or service.

### Government Digital Service

I've worked for GDS since 2020, existing in that lockdown air gap where I had my interview in an office but worked from home on my first day. I started out working on the principal [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) website where I worked on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/), accessibility on GOV.UK and navigation on GOV.UK. A lot of the work I did was subtle, involving under-the-hood changes to improve accessibility or performance, but some more visible things I helped build include [an update to the GOV.UK Frontend accordion component](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2021/10/29/how-we-made-the-gov-uk-accordion-component-more-accessible/) and [a new GOV.UK homepage](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2021/12/13/updating-the-gov-uk-homepage/) (although they've [redone my work since I left](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/11/01/a-bold-new-look-for-the-gov-uk-homepage/)).

Now I work for the GOV.UK Design System team, helping maintain the visual language and frontend infrastructure of over a thousand digital services. Some things I've built that I'm proud of include [Pagination](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/) and [Exit this Page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/exit-this-page/).

Working here I've learnt a lot about accessibility and the User Centered bit of User Centered Design and care a great deal about both. Speaking of which.
