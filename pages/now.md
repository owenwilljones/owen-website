This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a concept I nicked from [Steve](https://visitmy.website/now/).

## At the moment I'm...

- being a frontend developer for the GOV.UK Design System team at GDS; specifically right now I'm:
    - finishing off an MVP of a GOV.UK brand guidelines website
    - planning bits of training to upskill my teammates on techy subjects
- making this website better and more interesting, time allowing
- learning as much basic Japanese as I can ahead of a big holiday next year
- watching [Hajime no Ippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_no_Ippo)
- watching [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek), from the beginning
- playing [Death Stranding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stranding)

## Later on I'd like to...

- spend more time understanding design tokens
- learn [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and get one or more of my small game ideas on the screen
- resume learning Brazilian Portuguese
- pick up where I left off with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or maybe try a different combat sport
- spend more time making stuff in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)
- play all the games; some notable ones I'd like to check out:
    - [DELTARUNE chapters 3 and 4](https://deltarune.com/)
    - [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://hollowknightsilksong.com/)
    - [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33)
    - [Void Stranger](https://se-made.com/voidstranger.html)
    - [UFO 50](https://50games.fun/)
    - [Nine Sols](https://shop.redcandlegames.com/projects/ninesols)
