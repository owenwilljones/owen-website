This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a concept I nicked from [Steve](https://visitmy.website/now/).

## At the moment I'm...

- being a frontend developer for the GOV.UK Design System team and GDS (Government Digital Service, **not** GOV.UK Design System)
- making this website better and more interesting
- making my way through the [Deque University WAS course](https://dequeuniversity.com/online-courses/web-accessibility)
- learning Portuguese
- working towards my second white belt stripe and eventually blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- experimenting with coffee brewing
- playing [Okami (HD)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/587620/Okami_HD/)
- playing [the new Zelda where you actually play as Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Echoes_of_Wisdom)
- listening to the early R.E.M. albums (Murmur through to Life's Rich Pageant)

## Later on I'd like to...

- tighten up my typescript knowledge
- learn [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and get one or more of my small game ideas on the screen
- spend more time making stuff in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)
- play all the games; some notable ones I'm thinking about:
    - [Indika](https://indikathegame.com/)
    - [UFO 50](https://50games.fun/)
    - [Arctic Eggs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/)
    - [Mouthwashing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/)
    - [Nine Sols](https://shop.redcandlegames.com/projects/ninesols)
