        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>How I got here</h2>
<p>I grew up in a little village in the West Sussex. In 2009 I swapped the Sussex countryside for bracing sea breezes when I went to Portsmouth to study Computer Game Technology. After failing to get into the video games industry and moving back home, I started working on websites and now call myself a frontend developer. In 2018 I severed my ties to nature altogether and moved to London where I currently live.</p>
<h2>What I do for work</h2>
<p>At the moment I'm a senior frontend developer working for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service</a> in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System team</a>. I've worked in a few places but the ones I thought were most interesting were...</p>
<h3>Shelter</h3>
<p>I worked for <a href="https://www.shelter.org.uk/">Shelter</a> for 2 years in their digital campaigns team and later as part of their digital transformation team, converting a huge CMS monolith into a JAMstack project. Whilst I was there I developed a taste for web Design-with-a-capital-D, tech communities of practice and putting my skills towards a positive cause instead of the sale of a product or service.</p>
<h3>Government Digital Service</h3>
<p>I've worked for GDS since 2020, existing in that lockdown air gap where I had my interview in an office but worked from home on my first day. I started out working on the principal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> website where I worked on <a href="https://www.data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a>, accessibility on GOV.UK and navigation on GOV.UK. A lot of the work I did was subtle, involving under-the-hood changes to improve accessibility or performance, but some more visible things I helped build include <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2021/10/29/how-we-made-the-gov-uk-accordion-component-more-accessible/">an update to the GOV.UK Frontend accordion component</a> and <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2021/12/13/updating-the-gov-uk-homepage/">a new GOV.UK homepage</a> (although they've <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/11/01/a-bold-new-look-for-the-gov-uk-homepage/">redone my work since I left</a>).</p>
<p>Now I work for the GOV.UK Design System team, helping maintain the visual language and frontend infrastructure of over a thousand digital services. Some things I've built that I'm proud of include <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/">Pagination</a> and <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/exit-this-page/">Exit this Page</a>.</p>
<p>Working here I've learnt a lot about accessibility and the User Centered bit of User Centered Design and care a great deal about both. Speaking of which.</p>
